The sparse triangular solve kernel, SpTRSV, is an important building block for a number of numerical linear algebra routines. It is commonly considered challenging to parallelize and scale even on a moderate number of cores. This challenge is due to the fact that triangular solver typically has frequent discrete memory access, load embalances between the tasks.

Huawei Kunpeng920 is an ARMv8-based server CPU with up to 64 cores, supporting ARM NEON 128-bit SIMD instruction set.
